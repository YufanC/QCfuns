## Introduction
QCfuns package is a collection of R functions aiming to facilitate outputs validation
process. The functions can interact with each other and all together construct
a workflow that is efficient and easy to follow.

There are two types of functions in the workflow:

* Data to table functions. These functions take a dataframe of ADaM structure
as input and output a table-like dataframe. The names of these functions always
start with "qc_" and end with the type of table they are creating, 
such as qc_demo, qc_shift.

* Utility functions. Utility functions are functions that perform tasks
other than creating table-like dataframe from ADaM dataset. These functions
include addQCscript, qc_rtf2df, qc_compare2xlsx and qc_batchrun.

## Key functions
`qc_rtf`, `qc_comparedf` and `qc_batchrun` are the three key functions in the QC
workflow introduced by QCfuns package.

```{r out.width="100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("QCworkflow.png")
```

### Read in rtf files
rtf layout

```{r out.width="80%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rtf.png")
```

R dataframe (Get rid of title, footnotes and empty lines)

```{r out.width="80%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rtfdf.png")
```

### Compare dataframes
qc_comparedf function leverages the compare_df function from the compareDF package to generate a concise and color-coded summary of comparison results between the data frame created and the data frame extracted from the rtf file

```{r out.width="60%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("compare.png")
```

### Batchrun
qc_batchrun function can digest the results from qc_comparedf and produce a comprehensive summary of the validation status for multiple outputs simultaneously with log and comparison output for each individual script. The qc_batchrun can be executable not only in RStudio interactively, but also allow users to run batch jobs independently of the RStudio IDE.

```{r out.width="100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("batchrun.gif")
```

Scripts with errors and mismatched results will be on the top of the summary report. Individual comparing results can be accessed by hyperlinks

```{r out.width="60%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("batchrun_result.png")
```
